This HTML, JavaScript, and CSS code creates a simple **Age Calculator** website. Here's an overview of how it works:

### Description:
- **Purpose:** The website allows users to input their birthdate and calculates their current age in years, months, and days.
- **Functionality:** 
  - A user enters their birthdate using a date picker (`<input type="date">`).
  - When the "Calculate Age" button is clicked, a JavaScript function (`calculateAge()`) calculates the user's age based on the current date.
  - The result is displayed dynamically below the button, showing the user's age in years, months, and days.

### Key Features:
1. **Responsive Design:** The container has a max-width of 400px, ensuring it looks good on different screen sizes. The layout adjusts using padding and margins.
2. **Styled User Interface:** 
   - The page uses a clean, minimalist design with a white background for the calculator section and a shadow effect to make it stand out.
   - Input fields and buttons are styled for better usability and a modern look.
   - The button changes color on hover to improve interactivity.
3. **Error Handling:**
   - If no birthdate is entered, a message is displayed asking the user to input their birthdate.
   - Success and error messages are styled differently (green for success and red for errors) to make them noticeable.

### How It Works:
- **Date Input:** The user selects their birthdate.
- **JavaScript Calculation:**
  - The current date is fetched using `new Date()`.
  - The selected birthdate is converted into a date object.
  - The age is calculated by comparing the years, months, and days between the two dates, accounting for month and day adjustments if necessary.
- **Displaying Results:** The calculated age is displayed in the `<p>` element with id `result`, and styled according to whether the calculation was successful or not.

This age calculator is a functional, user-friendly web app for calculating someone's age quickly and easily.
